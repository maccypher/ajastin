# Ajastin
(f. finish = 'timer' or 'alarm clock')

A simple alarm clock, made with REACT.
This is my first real REACT project I created in cooperation with [Robin Wieruch](https://github.com/rwieruch). All code is documented inline.

# Requirements
I used the [npm module uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) to generate unique IDs for every alarm clock.

# Usage
Because of I started this project by using ['Create-React-App'](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) you can do this too.
If you are using 'Create-React-App' just put all the files from here into the 'src/' folder.

# Extension
![Desktop Menubar Extension](screenshot.jpg)

As I want to use this small app as a menubar integration for my Mac, I put it all into an Electron app environment and used the [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar) extension to create a menubar desktop application with Electron. To document this here would go beyond the scope and would possibly distract from the basic goal. It was a little bit tricky to match all my needs, but I'm sure you will figure it out, if you wanna do something similar.
